# Ocean-Sailing-Routes

A module that generates feasible oceanic routes for vessels to be used as input for routing and network problems.
Utilizes IHO Oceans shapefile (Flanders Marine Institute (2018). IHO Sea Areas, version 3) and produces triangle meshes for the routes vessels could use.

**Disclaimer: The routes are not intended to be used for navigation purposes. No responsibility will be taken by the author in this regard.**

The code doesn't include the shapefile as per Licence requirements by Flanders Marine Institute. The file could be downloaded for free at http://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php then IHO Sea Areas.

Dependencies: 
geopandas 0.5.0
numpy 1.16.4
meshpy 2018.2.1

Input: 
      
  path_to_ocean_scale: File name or path to IHO World Seas shapefile as 
  distributed in marineregions.org by Flanders Marine Institute. No 
  direct download is permitted as per License, hence no direct 
  availability through code. 
  Download the latest shapefile and use as input for this code.
  
  polygon_nu: The polygon number as defined in the IHO World Seas 
  Shapefile from 0 to 21.

Output: 
  
  File of Array of Numpy Array that includes an array of the 
  points and an array of the point combinations by index, that creates 
  every triangle mesh.

Code development:
  
  1. A shapefile with the IHO world seas polygons is read.
  2. An individual polygon from the former shapefile is used as basis
  for the creation of an exterior linering and facets .
  (order of linereings connection) that serves as input for 
  meshpy.triangle.
  3. Meshpy triangle result (points,facets) given as numpy arrays
  4. Refinement of meshpy triangles into 4 subdivisions for every 
  triangle taking the former point results as input
  5.Values exported as numpy files with the number of the polygon as 
  the name.
